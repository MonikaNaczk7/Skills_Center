# Skills_Center
Database I've created by myself from the scratch. 

Skills Center is an example of simple database for a little companies that wants to organise and storage the informations about their clients, services and activity of services. Skill Center is a place where athletes can sign up for individual or group practice sessions to develop themselves in their sports. 

All the data I put inside,is not real, I made it for the need of this project, as an example of creating a database from scratch. 

In the file analysis you will find an answers for 3 questions: 

1. What are the namses of the clients that signed up for the most services?
2. What are the names of coach who are the most active?
3. What is a total income from each industry (basketball, soocer, footbal, volleyball, swimming, mental preparation, nutrition, physical preparation) ordered from the biggest to the smallest.
